Added URP compatibility from 2021.3.24 and later.


When importing the pack in a URP project, open the "URP_Install_Toon City" file from the project hierarchy.
Right after installing, right click the "Models" and "Prefabs" folders and select "Reimport" if the asset previews are pink.

Renderer settings:

You might want to check the "Depth Texture" and "Opaque Texture" boxes just in case there are some custom shaders coming in the next updates.
Make sure the "Lut size" in the "Post-processing" tab is set to 16 instead of 32.
